Successfully completed requests are confirmed with an http status code of `200` and 
contain the appropriate response message in the body.

If the request could not be completed successfully, this is indicated by a status code 
of `400` or higher and – if possible (some errors are generated by the web server itself, 
or the web application firewall and are thus outside of our control) – an error message 
stating the reason of the failure is included in the body of the response. The presence 
of an error message as specified in this document can be derived from the content type: 
if it’s `application/json`, then there is an error message present.
