If you include the redirect pages into page using an iframe, you can react on size changes 
of the iframe content by listening to a message event containing the new sizing information.

Please note: Depending on the bank, issuer, or payment provider, the page can try to break 
out of the iframe or lack telling you the actual size of the content.
