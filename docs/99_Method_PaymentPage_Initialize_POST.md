This interface provides a simple integration of Saferpay without the need to implement a user interface for card data entry (the 'eCommerce' Saferpay license). You will get a redirect link to our payment page.<br>            <br>            After the payment page processing was finished, the payer is redirected back to the shop. The redirect address is chosen depending on the outcome of the request (success, failure, abort). If the payer is returned to the success url provided in the InitializeRequest, an authorization or even a completed transaction will have been done. So even if you don’t call Verify or Capture, the financial flow may have been triggered (depending on the payment provider – please consult the provider specific information).<br>            <br>            Important: the payer might modify the return address (e.g. replace failure address with success url).  If the payer returns to your success url, be sure to retrieve the outcome of the transaction and more information on it by calling PaymentPage/Verify Assert for the given token.
